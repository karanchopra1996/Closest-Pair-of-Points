Closest Pair of Points

Implement the closest pair of points algorithm. For your output, the distance between the closest pair of points in every recursive call (including the overall solution) output to the console.To make sure that we get the same results for every call, make sure that, when there is an odd number of items, the left group (smaller x-coordinates) has one more item than the right group (larger x-coordinates). In any subproblem with three or fewer points, calculate the distances using brute-force. For full credit, algorithm run in O(n log n) time.Input file will consist of n points, with n specified on the first line, and n additional lines containing the x- and y-coordinates, which will be real numbers (not integers). The file should be hardcoded to the name program2data.txt. For example
